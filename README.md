# UKIMD-Maps
Code and selection of plots of UK IMD Quintiles for given areas in Scotland, England and Wales.

# Aims

This project started as a way of representing the distribution of Deprivation accross the Island of Great Britain. This includes geographical data from England & Wales and Scotland (LSOA and Datazone boundaries respectively). These small areas are assigned to ranked deprivation quintile groups based on an Index which adjusts the scores of the constituent countries small-area deprivation indices onto a consistent and comparable scale. More info about the measure can be found here:

The dark purple areas are the least deprived and the bright yellow areas are the most deprived.
